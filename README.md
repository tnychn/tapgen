<p align="center"><small><strong>Tony's Almighty Project Generator</strong></small></p>

A general-purpose, language-agnostic, yet simple and fast (i.e. *almighty*) project generator to bootstrap and scaffold your projects easily.

> Wanna start developing your new project real quick? Run a single command and you can start coding right away.

> Productivity++: No more wasting your time copy-and-pasting boilerplate starter code.

> Like [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), but *faaaster* (written in Rust).
